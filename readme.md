## Objective

The goal of this project is to apply reinforcement learning (RL) to the domain of pedestrian simulation, traditionally 
dominated by agent-based models where pedestrian decisions are scripted manually. 
This involves developing a robust RL framework that trains an agent to optimize behaviors through a reward system 
designed to encapsulate goal orientation, basic proxemics, and way-finding strategies. 

Our approach includes creating a progressively challenging curriculum to aid the agent in acquiring complex pedestrian 
behaviors such as orientation, walking, and interacting with other pedestrians in a simulated environment. 

The framework leverages Godot and Godot-RL-Agents for implementing and testing the simulation.

## Tools

The main tools and methodologies used to conduct this study are provided below:

### Godot Engine
[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) is an open-source game engine used for the development of 2D and 3D games. Godot provides a flexible and powerful environment for game development and simulation tasks, such as the one undertaken in this project.

### Godot-RL-Agents
[Godot-RL-Agents](https://github.com/edbeeching/godot_rl_agents) is a plugin for the Godot Engine designed to integrate reinforcement learning algorithms directly into game environments. This tool allows for real-time interaction and learning in complex simulated environments.

### Stable Baselines 3

[**Stable Baselines 3**](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3) is a reinforcement learning library in Python, 
developed by OpenAI.
It provides a set of stable and reliable RL algorithm implementations, designed to be easily
accessible and usable by developers. 

## Setup

### Windows

Here's the setup for Windows:

#### Open the project on Godot
1. **Install Godot**: You can download and install Godot from [here](https://godotengine.org/download/windows/)!

2. **Clone this repository**: Clone this repository 
```
https://github.com/Ruben-2828/RL-Godot-Pedestrian-Simulation.git
```
3. **Launch Godot**: Extract the files and run the Godot exe. The godot engine will open

4. **Import Project**: In the launcher, press Import and find the repository. Then press Import & Edit. 
Now the project should be open!

#### Enable RL to Godot

1. **Install Anaconda**: We recommend installing anaconda to have a complete and integrated environment. You can do it 
from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download)!

2. **Create an environment**: Open Anaconda Prompt and create an environment with python 3.8:
```
conda create --name myenv python=3.8
```
3. **Activate the environment**: After creating the environment, you need to activate it using the following command:
```
conda activate myenv
```
4. **Install the dependencies**: You can install the dependencies of this project using this following commands:
```
pip install godot-rl
```
```
pip install stable-baselines
```
#### Run the project
1. **Activate RL-Agents**: Enable rl-agents using this command from Anaconda Prompt:
```
gdrl
```
2. **Press Run**: From Godot, press F5 or the Run command to run the project!

Every time you need to run the project, you will have to run these two commands.
